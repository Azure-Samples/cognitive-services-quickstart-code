'''
Computer Vision Quickstart for Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services. 
Uses local and remote images in each example.

Prerequisites:
    - Install the Computer Vision SDK:
      pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision
    - Install PIL:
      pip install --upgrade pillow
    - Create folder and collect images: 
      Create a folder called "images" in the same folder as this script.
      Go to this website to download images:
        https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/tree/master/ComputerVision/Images
      Add the following 7 images (or use your own) to your "images" folder: 
        faces.jpg, gray-shirt-logo.jpg, handwritten_text.jpg, landmark.jpg, 
        objects.jpg, printed_text.jpg and type-image.jpg

Run the entire file to demonstrate the following examples:
    - OCR: Read File using the Read API, extract text - remote
    - OCR: Read File using the Read API, extract text - local

OCR: Read File using the Read API, extract text - remote
This example will extract text in an image, then print results, line by line.
This API call can also extract handwriting style text (not shown).

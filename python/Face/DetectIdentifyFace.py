'''
This sample shows a mixed-use case for Person Group, Person Group Person, Detect, and Identify Face API calls.
It starts by creating a Person Group with a few images of the same person.     
It then uses different test images to try to identify if they are found in the person group or not.
Finally, for all images NOT found in the person group, a new Person object is made of each unique image
and added to the existing person group.        

Install the Face SDK library:
pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-vision-face

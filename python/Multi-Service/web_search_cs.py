This quickstart performs a Bing Web Search with a celebrity name, returning similar images.

Uses the general Cognitive Services key/endpoint. It's used when you want to 
combine many Cognitive Services with just one authentication key/endpoint. 
Services are not combined here, but could be potentially. 

Install the Bing Web Search SDK from a command prompt or IDE terminal:
  python -m pip install azure-cognitiveservices-search-websearch

# URL image, used as a reference only
# To detect the faces and find the celebrity in this photo, use the Computer Vision service (optional).
query_image_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/master/ComputerVision/Images/faces.jpg"

# The name of the celebrity you want to search for on the web.
celebrity_name = 'Bill Gates'

subscription_key = 'PASTE_YOUR_BING_SEARCH_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY_HERE'
endpoint = 'PASTE_YOUR_BING_SEARCH_ENDPOINT_HERE'

Authenticate a client.

Bing Web Search
Using the name of a celebrity, search for other images of them and return the source URL and image.
This example uses the API calls:
  search()

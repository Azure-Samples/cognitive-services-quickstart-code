Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics - Get sentiment

This example, using the general Cognitive Services key/endpoint. It's used when you want to 
combine many Cognitive Services with just one authentication key/endpoint. 
Services are not combined here, but could be potentially. 

Install the Text Analytics SDK from a command prompt or IDE terminal:
  pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-language-textanalytics
'''

subscription_key = "PASTE_YOUR_TEXT_ANALYTICS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY_HERE"
endpoint = "PASTE_YOUR_TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT_HERE"

'''
AUTHENTICATE
Create a Text Analytics client.
'''
credentials = CognitiveServicesCredentials(subscription_key)
text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint=endpoint, credentials=credentials)

'''
TEXT ANALYTICS

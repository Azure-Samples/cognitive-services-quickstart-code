# Quickstart output: Python SDK layout model (beta)

[Reference documentation](/python/api/azure-ai-formrecognizer/azure.ai.formrecognizer?view=azure-python-preview&preserve-view=true) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/azure-ai-formrecognizer_3.2.0b3/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/) | [Package (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-formrecognizer/3.2.0b3/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/azure-ai-formrecognizer_3.2.0b3/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/samples/README.md)

You can get started using the Azure Form Recognizer layout model with the [Python programming language quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/quickstarts/try-v3-python-sdk#layout-model). The layout model analyzes and extracts tables, lines, words, and selection marks like radio buttons and check boxes from forms and documents, without the need to train a model. Here is the expected outcome from the layout model quickstart code:

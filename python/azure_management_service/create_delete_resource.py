# This script requires the following modules:
#	python -m pip install azure-mgmt-cognitiveservices
#	python -m pip install azure-identity
#
# SDK: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-mgmt-cognitiveservices/azure.mgmt.cognitiveservices?view=azure-python 
#
# This script runs under Python 3.4 or later.
# The application ID and secret of the service principal you are using to connect to the Azure Management Service.

# To create a service principal with the Azure CLI, see:
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest
# To install the Azure CLI, see:
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest

# To create a service principal with Azure PowerShell, see: 
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/create-azure-service-principal-azureps?view=azps-3.3.0
# To install Azure PowerShell, see:
# https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell

# When you create a service principal, you will see it has both an ID and an application ID.
# For example, if you create a service principal with Azure PowerShell, it should look like the following:

# Secret                : System.Security.SecureString
# ServicePrincipalNames : {<application ID>, <application URL>}
# ApplicationId         : <application ID>
# ObjectType            : ServicePrincipal
# DisplayName           : <name>
# Id                    : <ID>
# Type                  :

# <snippet_constants>

# The name of the Azure resource group in which you want to create the resource.
# You can find resource groups in the Azure Dashboard under Home > Resource groups.
resource_group_name = "PASTE_YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_HERE"

# The name of the custom subdomain to use when you create the resource. This is optional.
# For example, if you create a Bing Search v7 resource with the custom subdomain name 'my-search-resource',
# your resource would have the endpoint https://my-search-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/.

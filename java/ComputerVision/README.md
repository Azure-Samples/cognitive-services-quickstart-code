# Computer Vision SDK Quickstart

This quickstart uses image classification and object detection on an image with the Computer Vision Cognitive Service. It will retrieve and print information (including text) from the image. Maven is used.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- If you don't have a Microsoft Azure subscription, you can visit [the Microsoft Cognitive Services Web site](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/), create a new Azure account, and try Cognitive Services for free.
- Get an [Azure Computer Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) account to get your key and endpoint.
- Add COMPUTER_VISION_KEY and COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT to your environment variables with your key and endpoint as values.
- After cloning this repo (see below), create a 'resources' folder in your 'src/main/' folder. 
- Add images **landmark.jpg** and **printed_text.jpg** to it, downloaded locally from here:
  https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/tree/master/ComputerVision/Images

### Clone and run

Execute from the command line:

1. `git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code.git`
1. `cd cognitive-services-quickstart-code/java/ComputerVision`
1. `mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false`

# Quickstart output: Python SDK prebuilt-invoice model (beta)

[Reference documentation](/java/api/overview/azure/ai-formrecognizer-readme?view=azure-java-preview&preserve-view=true) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/azure-ai-formrecognizer_4.0.0-beta.4/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/) | [Package (Maven)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure/azure-ai-formrecognizer/4.0.0-beta.4/jar) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/src/samples/README.md)

You can get started using the Azure Form Recognizer layout model with the [Java programming language quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/quickstarts/try-v3-java-sdk#prebuilt-model). The layout model analyzes and extracts tables, lines, words, and selection marks like radio buttons and check boxes from forms and documents, without the need to train a model. Here is the expected outcome from the prebuilt-invoice model quickstart code:

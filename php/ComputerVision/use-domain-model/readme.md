# Quickstart: Recognize domain-specific content using the REST API and PHP with Computer Vision

In this quickstart, you use a domain model to identify landmarks or, optionally, celebrities in a remotely stored image by using Computer Vision's REST API. With the [Recognize Domain Specific Content](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e200) method, you can apply a domain-specific model to recognize content within an image.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can visit [the Microsoft Cognitive Services Web site](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/), create a new Azure account, and try Cognitive Services for free.

## Prerequisites

- You must have [PHP](https://secure.php.net/downloads.php) installed.
- You must have [Pear](https://pear.php.net) installed.
- You must have a key for Computer Vision. You can get a free trial key from [Try Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/?api=computer-vision). Or, follow the instructions in [Create a Cognitive Services account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) to subscribe to Computer Vision and get your key.

## Create and run the sample

To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

1. Install the PHP5 [`HTTP_Request2`](https://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request2) package.
   1. Open a command prompt window as an administrator.
   1. Run the following command:

      ```console
      pear install HTTP_Request2
      ```

   1. After the package is successfully installed, close the command prompt window.

1. Copy the following code into a text editor.
1. Make the following changes in code where needed:
    1. Replace the value of `key` with your key.
    1. Replace the value of `uriBase` with the endpoint URL for the [Recognize Domain Specific Content](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e200) method from the Azure region where you obtained your keys, if necessary.
    1. Optionally, replace the value of `imageUrl` with the URL of a different image that you want to analyze.
    1. Optionally, replace the value of the `domain` request parameter with `celebrites` if you want to use the `celebrities` domain model instead of the `landmarks` domain model.
1. Save the code as a file with a `.php` extension. For example, `use-domain-model.php`.
1. Open a browser window with PHP support.
1. Drag and drop the file into the browser window.

```php
<html>
<head>
    <title>Analyze Domain Model Sample</title>
</head>
<body>
<?php
// Replace <key> with a valid key.
$ocpApimkey = '<key>';

// You must use the same location in your REST call as you used to obtain
// your keys. For example, if you obtained your keys
// from westus, replace "westcentralus" in the URL below with "westus".
$uriBase = 'https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0/';

// Change 'landmarks' to 'celebrities' to use the Celebrities model.
$domain = 'landmarks';

$imageUrl =
    'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Space_Needle_2011-07-04.jpg';

require_once 'HTTP/Request2.php';

$request = new Http_Request2($uriBase . 'models/' . $domain . '/analyze');
$url = $request->getUrl();

$headers = array(
    // Request headers
    'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
    'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key' => $ocpApimkey
);
$request->setHeader($headers);

$parameters = array(
    // Request parameters
    'model' => $domain
);
$url->setQueryVariables($parameters);

$request->setMethod(HTTP_Request2::METHOD_POST);

// Request body parameters
$body = json_encode(array('url' => $imageUrl));

// Request body
$request->setBody($body);

try
{
    $response = $request->send();
    echo "<pre>" .
        json_encode(json_decode($response->getBody()), JSON_PRETTY_PRINT) . "</pre>";
}
catch (HttpException $ex)
{
    echo "<pre>" . $ex . "</pre>";
}
?>
</body>
</html>
```

## Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON. The sample website parses and displays a successful response in the browser window, similar to the following example:

```json
{
    "result": {
        "landmarks": [
            {
                "name": "Space Needle",
                "confidence": 0.9998177886009216
            }
        ]
    },
    "requestId": "4d26587b-b2b9-408d-a70c-1f8121d84b0d",
    "metadata": {
        "height": 4132,
        "width": 2096,
        "format": "Jpeg"
    }
}
```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the file, and then uninstall the PHP5 `HTTP_Request2` package. To uninstall the package, do the following steps:

1. Open a command prompt window as an administrator.
2. Run the following command:

   ```console
   pear uninstall HTTP_Request2
   ```

3. After the package is successfully uninstalled, close the command prompt window.

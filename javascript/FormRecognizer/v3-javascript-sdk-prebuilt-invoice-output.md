# Quickstart output: Python SDK prebuilt-invoice model (beta)

[Reference documentation](/javascript/api/@azure/ai-form-recognizer/?view=azure-node-preview&preserve-view=true) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/@azure/ai-form-recognizer_4.0.0-beta.3/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/ai-form-recognizer/v/4.0.0-beta.3) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/samples/v4-beta/javascript/README.md)

You can get started using the Azure Form Recognizer layout model with the [JavaScript programming language quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/quickstarts/try-v3-javascript-sdk#prebuilt-model). The layout model analyzes and extracts tables, lines, words, and selection marks like radio buttons and check boxes from forms and documents, without the need to train a model. Here is the expected outcome from the prebuilt-invoice model quickstart code:
